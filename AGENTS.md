# Agent Instructions

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may
all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in
`node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in
monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before
writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at
`node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a
diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps
the tree clean.

## Shared Engineering Guidelines

> The word "module" means a cohesive unit of code in the relevant language or
> framework.

- Prefer established language, framework, and standard-library capabilities over
  custom implementations. Use modern, idiomatic syntax.
- Apply SOLID and GRASP where they make responsibilities clearer. A little
  ceremony is welcome when it visibly produces smaller, more cohesive modules.
- Keep one module per file unless a module is private or used only by the code
  declaring it. Do not split cohesive models or private helpers solely by size.
- Keep endpoint handlers, service wiring, dependency checks, and implementations
  in concern-specific files or folders; keep composition roots small.
- Prefer guard clauses, descriptive domain names, and named conditions over
  dense control flow. Centralize genuinely repeated rules, constants, encoding,
  and validation in small intention-revealing helpers. Keep sibling paths
  behaviorally consistent.
- Refactor when it is necessary to implement or review the story cleanly. Avoid
  unrelated cleanup unless it is required for canonical validation to pass.
- At dependency boundaries, distinguish invalid data from unavailability,
  propagate cancellation, preserve exception causes, keep diagnostics
  secret-free, and cover changed failure behavior with focused tests.
- Give each filtering, normalization, validation, and configuration policy one
  authoritative enforcement owner. Add another enforcement layer only for a
  distinct trust boundary or independently stated failure mode.
- For telemetry, application code owns secret filtering, cardinality, and event
  semantics; telemetry infrastructure owns transport, routing, batching,
  authentication, and sampling. Do not duplicate application field allowlists
  downstream without a distinct trust-boundary requirement.
- This is not an enterprise-grade workflow. Cover the happy path and the most
  obvious and material failure paths; do not harden against every conceivable
  edge case.
- Treat fresh measurement as a blocking acceptance gate only when the SEED
  explicitly labels it as one and identifies the evidence, environment, and
  owner. Do not turn general words such as "measure", "prove", or "calibrate"
  into an unstated hardware or harness requirement.
- When the SEED authorizes recorded evidence or a conservative provisional
  default, use it, state the known limitation and recalibration trigger, and do
  not demand fresh characterization. Stories must distinguish mandatory release
  gates from provisional defaults and post-release triggers.

## Verification Guidelines

- Do not hand off validated work until all applicable canonical validation
  passes without errors.
- Unit tests start no external processes. Integration tests may provision
  task-owned dependency containers and must not require a prestarted project
  stack, a fixed shared Compose project, or a fixed host port.
- Automated tests are limited to unit and integration tests. Do not create or
  demand smoke, end-to-end, browser end-to-end, or deployment tests.
- Native configuration rendering, image building, and release-archive assembly
  are build validation, not smoke or deployment tests. Prefer a tool's native
  parser, renderer, compiler, or build command. Add a bespoke structural
  validator only when native tooling cannot prove a required invariant.
- Test each behavior once at the lowest stable boundary that can prove it. Add a
  cross-boundary integration test only when behavior can fail despite the
  lower-level check, such as serialization compatibility, dependency semantics,
  or framework wiring.
- Require negative-path coverage for trust boundaries, security rules,
  cancellation and concurrency, atomic data replacement, data-loss risks, and
  previously observed regressions. Do not require a test for every branch,
  defensive condition, or log call.
- Log prose is not an API. Test exact text only when the wording is itself a
  stable filtering or operator contract. Otherwise test severity, event
  identity, required fields, forbidden sensitive fields, and cardinality with
  one representative event per policy class.
- Do not reproduce the same assertion across unit, integration, image,
  configuration, script, and documentation checks merely for reassurance. Reuse
  an existing test at the owning boundary and delete redundant checks when a
  stronger authoritative check supersedes them.
- Do not introduce a test seam, interface, fake, fixture family, or helper whose
  complexity exceeds the behavior it verifies.
- Test volume, branch count, mutation survival, and assertion count are not
  goals. Validation ends when the story's observable acceptance criteria and
  material regression risks are covered.

## Documentation and Comment Guidelines

- First make production code explain itself through precise names, explicit
  types, cohesive structure, ordinary control flow, and established idioms.
- Add a concise inline comment only when important reasoning cannot be recovered
  quickly from the code: a non-obvious invariant, security or compatibility
  constraint, protocol ownership, calibrated limit, or why a simpler-looking
  implementation is incorrect.
- Do not require file, module, function, or test comments merely for coverage.
  Do not narrate names or create a Markdown document instead of clarifying the
  code. Prefer a precise comment beside the constrained mechanism.
- Keep README content to project purpose, expected environment variables and
  their contract, and non-obvious operator constraints. Do not teach standard
  Docker, Compose, shell, Git, or service-lifecycle commands, and do not narrate
  implementation details.
- Do not create separate feature, developer, implementation, test, or
  architecture documents unless the SEED explicitly requires one. Encode
  behavior in code and focused tests; explain remaining non-obvious reasoning
  inline.

## Runtime and Container Safety

- Use ports in the range 65100-65199 for Docker Compose, Docker containers, and
  services in general.
- Bind every published Docker or Compose port explicitly to `127.0.0.1`.
- Test-only containers may use dependency-native container ports and
  Docker-assigned ephemeral host ports, but every published test port must bind
  explicitly to `127.0.0.1`.
- Never require `sudo`, privileged containers, firewall changes, or a shared
  prestarted dependency.
- Harden images made by the project as rootless and distroless with read-only
  filesystems. Do not impose project-owned hardening on third-party images.

## Architecture Guidelines

This is a reusable Strapi 5 + Next.js template meant to give a best-in-class
foundation. Treat the architecture as an asset to extend, not rewrite.

This template is deliberately SSR + ISR. Treat that rendering model as a
contract to preserve while building a specific site. The bundled styles and
components are demonstrative presentation examples, not design laws or assets
to reuse as-is:

- The frontend is SSR + ISR only. Do not add `generateStaticParams`, a static
  export, or build-time prerendering of content. On-demand revalidation flows
  through `app/refresh/route.ts`; extend `cms/tags.ts` and `cms/cache.ts` when
  adding content types.
- Static routes (no dynamic segment) are prerendered at build time by default,
  and `"use cache"` data does not change that — Next bakes the fetch into the
  static shell. Any CMS-backed route must call `await io()` (from `next/cache`,
  in page components) or `await connection()` (from `next/server`, in metadata
  routes such as `sitemap.ts`) so the content is rendered at request time instead
  of forcing a build-time dependency on the backend.
- Keep and extend the target site's design while preserving the dispatch and
  CMS pipeline model. Own page-specific presentation under
  `frontend/components/<page>/`; use `components/layout/` only for site chrome,
  `components/shared/` only for genuinely cross-page presentation, and keep
  the cross-page dispatcher at `components/page-switch.tsx`.
- The discovery layer — list endpoints in `cms/client.ts`/`connector.ts`/`data.ts`,
  list pages under `app/(content)/*/page.tsx`, `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts` —
  must be extended alongside any new content type, not bolted on later.
- Collection routes (`app/(content)/articles|events|news/page.tsx`) render their
  `*-list-page.tsx` component directly; this is the one intentional exception to
  the page-switch dispatch, which exists for single-document pages.

- Never change the stack, and never alter the core frontend architecture.
- Frontend routes delegate to a single page-switch component
  (`frontend/components/page-switch.tsx`) that dispatches to concrete page
  components (`frontend/components/<page>/page.tsx`). Keep this dispatch model.
- Consume CMS data through `frontend/cms/` exactly as defined, including its
  caching approach: raw Strapi client (`client.ts`) → `connector.ts` maps raw
  data to frontend DTOs (`model.ts`) via `mappers.ts` → cached reads (`data.ts`
  using `"use cache"` with `cacheLife`/`cacheTag`) → webhook-driven revalidation
  (`webhook.ts` and `app/refresh/route.ts`). Do not replace this pipeline.
- When adding a content type, extend the existing pipeline end-to-end (schema →
  client → mapper → connector → cached read → cache tag/webhook mapping → list
  endpoint → sitemap → navigation entry → page-switch entry plus a page
  component) rather than a parallel path.
- You may add cross-cutting components in `frontend/components/` and use any
  Next.js feature as long as the architecture above is unchanged.
- Frontend tests use vitest and may be skipped only when they would only assert
  visuals. Non-visual server-side logic at trust boundaries (webhook secret and
  tag mapping, mapper validation, query serialization) is required coverage.
- Use Tailwind CSS as-is. Normalize genuinely repeated patterns into custom
  utilities. Creating a custom theme or a component/design system is allowed and
  recommended when the site calls for it (e.g., a showcase site).
- Keep Strapi 5 changes within its default mechanisms. Using the bootstrap phase
  with small helpers (as in `backend/src/bootstrap/`) is fine; do not add extra
  API endpoints through low-level Strapi plumbing.
- Apply Strapi 5 changes through its APIs or the admin UI (browser) so they are
  applied correctly. Avoid editing schema files directly unless unavoidable.
- Before changing content types in Strapi 5, request explicit user confirmation
  unless it was given in advance in the prompt.
- Do not produce or request any type of tests for the Strapi 5 backend. The
  proper verification is simply that it starts from an empty database.
- After any backend or frontend change, refresh the generated artifacts that
  document the API surface via the mise tasks `be:openapi` (writes
  `frontend/cms/schema.json`), `fe:openapi` (writes `frontend/cms/schema.d.ts`),
  and `be:types` when backend types changed.
- Upgrading Strapi 5 to a new version is forbidden unless the user explicitly
  asks for it.
